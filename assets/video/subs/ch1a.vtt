00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.437
OneSight clinics is all about taking access

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.058
to care to people who wouldn't necessarily

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:06.941
have access to that.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.539
Sometimes we work in regional and remote

5
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.519
locations around Australia and New Zealand,

6
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.130
sometimes in lower socio economic.

7
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.190
We will do a lot of work in homeless shelters,

8
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.950
drug and alcohol rehabilitation centres.

9
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.079
We work in migrant centres.

10
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.449
We're there trying to pick up those that wouldn't

11
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.309
have access through the normal channels.

12
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.129
We believe that everyone deserves access to

13
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.649
quality eye care and a pair of glasses if need

14
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.229
be. And that's why we'll keep going until

15
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.230
the world can see.

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.752
My KPI each morning when I get there, the bed is

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.840
how many lives can I improve for the better?

18
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.999
We bought the team in a team of volunteers.

19
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.313
We're doing some screening with the kids to try

20
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.920
and identify any needs that they might have

21
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.460
before they move on to school.

22
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.639
To ensure that they can see properly before they

23
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.229
start their educational journey.

24
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.899
A lot of kids we find can go through their whole

25
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.179
school career without getting their eyes tested.

26
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.700
And we find that just because

27
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.220
there is an optometrist or

28
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.068
an eye care specialist handy doesn't necessarily

29
00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.749
mean that mum and dad again take the kids there.

30
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.120
We find that by taking the services

31
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.203
to the schools and taking them to the

32
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.680
organisations with the people in need,

33
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.709
then we will uncover those people who ordinarily

34
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.090
just would not get tested.

35
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.429
For us in a kindergarten setting, what we're

36
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.488
looking at doing is trying to identify any

37
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.499
visual needs that kids might have at an early

38
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.279
age.

39
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.040
So it's important that kids get their eyes tested

40
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.840
every 12 months, two years.

41
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.383
And we're here providing that service for those

42
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.849
parents who wouldn't normally take their kids and

43
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.850
getting tested.

44
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.811
Usually during our screening clinics, we check to

45
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.310
see that they can see clearly in the distance.

46
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.594
We then check to make sure that their eyes are

47
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.569
working together and independently.

48
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.340
We make sure that they can read up close.

49
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.401
And then we're also doing some Stereopsis

50
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.575
test. That's just a fancy word that lets them

51
00:01:51.576 --> 00:01:52.956
know can they see in 3D.

52
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.709
And is there any colour deficiencies in

53
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.719
their vision before the optometrists are having a

54
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.072
look at the internals and making sure the of the

55
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.989
health of the eye.

56
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.179
There's a smile on the kid's faces when you go

57
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.749
in.

58
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.689
There is an absolutely incredible experience

59
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.449
to volunteer and to try and help these kids

60
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.710
see a little bit better.

61
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.229
It's important the work that we do, because we

62
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.582
know with kids, 80 per cent of their learning is

63
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.619
visual.

64
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.839
So if you can't see things

65
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.110
you can't learn.

66
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
If you can't learn.

67
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.390
You can't earn.

68
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.930
And it's very, very important that the children

69
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.269
have the best opportunity and the best start to

70
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.900
life in.
