00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.216
We've had Onesight coming in to conduct some

2
00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:04.349
vision screenings here with the children.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.629
Families have been extremely

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.500
happy with the ability to have that screening

5
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.869
conducted at the centre.

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.759
It provides an early intervention if

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.339
there's children that have challenges

8
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.653
or difficulties in any of those areas sometimes

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.710
it's not picked up.

10
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.279
Some of these things can be very subtle, but they

11
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.820
can still have an impact on children.

12
00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.820
It can certainly impact on the on their

13
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.339
behaviour, the self-esteem,

14
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.939
being able to communicate

15
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.829
and do things that they can see other children

16
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.969
accomplishing.

17
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.077
They're not getting halfway through prep or

18
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.919
halfway through you one and having to

19
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.019
then discover that they might have been something

20
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.070
that could have been done early on.

21
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.100
So my role within our OPSM and

22
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.649
Luxottica is a optical dispenser

23
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.420
for the flagship store in Brisbane City.

24
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.835
The thing that I get out of this is something

25
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.520
that I don't see as much

26
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.039
in a retail store where I give people glasses

27
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.679
every day.

28
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.934
The opportunities and sometimes the challenges

29
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.649
that families in certain areas that we go to,

30
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.885
they might not have an optometrist locally in

31
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.550
a screening like this.

32
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.189
It's knowing that a child isn't

33
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.139
going to go in to prep or isn't going to go into

34
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.109
school and not be able to see the board.

35
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.339
We've come in at the right time and we've been

36
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.180
able to give them a bit of a breadfruit show.

37
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.849
It's very rewarding.

38
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.400
It's so satisfying being able to see

39
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.139
the smile people get out of it as well.
