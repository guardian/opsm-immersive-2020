00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.339
The kindergarten in Ipswich today is the one of

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.080
the vision screening places that we're running.

3
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.629
Providing eye care and making

4
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.129
sure their eyes are all nice and healthy and

5
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:08.609
working.

6
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.830
And if there's anything that needs additional

7
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.751
attention, then we provide vision vouchers.

8
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.820
To be able to have those kids that have that

9
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.339
access to be able to have classes if they need

10
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.199
to. And eye tests and those sorts of things.

11
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.079
It's so important to be able to have

12
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.286
the kids have their eyesight checked early.

13
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.699
Because anything that may be going

14
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.760
astray will have a really big impact

15
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.080
on their lives down the track.

16
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.920
Especially when they start school.

17
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.919
And if they fall behind, it becomes very

18
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.060
difficult for them to catch up.

19
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.640
We have individual stations check the

20
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220
child's eye in certain ways.

21
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.824
How their eyes are working together.

22
00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:43.393
How they are able to see letters

23
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.889
or shapes at a long distance and a close

24
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:47.729
distance.

25
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.000
And their depth perception how they can see in 3D

26
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.930
and also the health of their eyes as well.

27
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.969
We say if there's any slight differences,

28
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.300
anything that needs further attention.

29
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.539
Then they'll have a vision voucher that allows

30
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.549
them to go in to get their eyes checked at a

31
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.649
local optometry practise.

32
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.920
And then if they need glasses, the on OneSight

33
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.299
charity provides that at no cost to them.

34
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.759
There's so many different impacts that it has on

35
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.239
their life.

36
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.759
So a social impact for kids and

37
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:12.458
adults alike.

38
00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:13.979
If they feel that they cannot fit in.

39
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.049
If they feel they cannot complete a task, then

40
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.610
they will often isolate themselves.

41
00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.780
And in the sense of self esteem, a

42
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.717
child can't say they can't study.

43
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.749
And if they can't study, they they feel like they

44
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.986
are unable to achieve.

45
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.180
For us to actually facilitate that.

46
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.569
It's amazing how you really see the impact

47
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.123
of people's lives being changed.

48
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.385
Someone who has not been able to have glasses

49
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.434
previously and suddenly be able to do that.

50
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.809
And have that feedback from the community that

51
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.549
they are being able to perform so much better

52
00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.939
now.

53
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.489
We are more than just

54
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.049
working 9:00 to 5:00.

55
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.989
We have this ability to be able to provide

56
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.629
vision and and support to those around

57
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.839
us.

58
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.554
And I think that's really awesome.
