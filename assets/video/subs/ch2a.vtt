00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.549
I'm Carolyn Stubley and I'm the nurse manager for

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.620
the We Help Ourselves organisation.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.349
So WHOS is an organisation of

4
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.310
residential alcohol and drug residential

5
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:10.630
treatment.

6
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.320
A lot of our clients who are either homeless

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.654
or come from a very chaotic lifestyle and

8
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.155
the last thing they probably do address is their

9
00:00:18.156 --> 00:00:19.156
eye sight.

10
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.839
They probably haven't had an eye test some for

11
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.229
years.

12
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.449
Some of them will never have had glasses.

13
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.335
The optometrists and volunteers all

14
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.360
come here and we set up the clinic.

15
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.899
It's really important that they get the

16
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.860
opportunity to get their eyes tested and

17
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.020
certainly to get free glasses.

18
00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.509
It's pretty amazing for them.

19
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.719
Some clients probably haven't even realised

20
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.509
the impact of not having great vision

21
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.960
has had on them.

22
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.319
So when they get their glasses, all of a sudden

23
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.049
it does open up the opportunity for different

24
00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.630
types of employment and study.

25
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.089
I think people who come to residential treatment

26
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.979
and all of a sudden are getting their physical

27
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.829
needs looked at are very grateful

28
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.929
because it's something they've neglected for a

29
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.299
long time because of the pure alcohol and drug

30
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.809
use.

31
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.420
The day we give out the glasses,

32
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.909
all of a sudden everyone's wearing glasses, which

33
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:12.689
is fantastic.

34
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.849
And everyone is saying, I didn't realise how bad

35
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.960
my eyesight was.

36
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.480
Now all of a sudden, they've got more confidence.

37
00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.797
So just to see the difference that it makes

38
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.546
for someone to have glasses is enough reward

39
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.459
for me. And just to see them, just

40
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.050
gain that extra confidence.

41
00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.409
I work for OPSM as a managing

42
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.390
optometrist in a Sydney store.

43
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.402
So one of the highlights of my year is

44
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.319
being involved in the WHOS clinic in Lilyfield

45
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.570
doing vision testing for those residents

46
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.869
there.

47
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.599
As optometrist every day I see people

48
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.520
who can easily access eye care.

49
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.770
They come to us, they come to the shop.

50
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.789
They can afford it.

51
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.092
One thing I love about working with WHOS

52
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.699
is that we are bringing the eye care

53
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.189
to them. To ensure that no one is left

54
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.010
without adequate good quality

55
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.089
eye care.

56
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.519
For the most common things we find at the WHO'S

57
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.159
clinic is that the men and women often just

58
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.719
haven't had an eye test for years.

59
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:12.219
If they have, they're walking around in oh,

60
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.999
glasses, crack glasses, scratch lenses

61
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.250
and the wrong prescription.

62
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.139
Something that I find amazing is the fact that

63
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.296
for many of these clients, they haven't even

64
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.759
realised that they couldn't see.

65
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.928
I've seen people who put glasses

66
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.189
on them for the first time and they're amazed

67
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.222
about what they can see.

68
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.277
So to see their lives turn around

69
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.469
in this way is amazing.

70
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.749
The power of a pair of glasses really can

71
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.889
transform lives.

72
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.310
It makes it worthwhile.
