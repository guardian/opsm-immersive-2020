1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.549
OneSight clinics is all about taking

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.726
access to care to people

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.264
who wouldn't necessarily have access

4
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.019
to that.

5
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.441
Sometimes we work in regional

6
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.383
and remote locations around

7
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.649
Australia and New Zealand, sometimes

8
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.130
in lower socio economic.

9
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.869
We will do a lot of work in

10
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.269
homeless shelters, drug and alcohol

11
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.950
rehabilitation centres.

12
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.079
We work in migrant centres.

13
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.729
We're there trying to pick up those

14
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.199
that wouldn't have access through

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.309
the normal channels.

16
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.410
We believe that everyone deserves

17
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.098
access to quality eye care and a

18
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.920
pair of glasses if need be.

19
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.719
And that's why we'll keep going

20
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.990
until the world can see.

21
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.870
My KPI each morning when I get

22
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.879
there, the bed is how many lives can

23
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
I improve for the better?

24
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.339
We bought the team in a team of

25
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.009
volunteers.

26
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.529
We're doing some screening with the

27
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.629
kids to try and identify any

28
00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.579
needs that they might have before

29
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.479
they move on to school.

30
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.279
To ensure that they can see properly

31
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.869
before they start their educational

32
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.469
journey.

33
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.359
A lot of kids we find can go

34
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.619
through their whole school career

35
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.179
without getting their eyes tested.

36
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.700
And we find that just because

37
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.979
there is an optometrist

38
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.990
or an eye care specialist handy

39
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.488
doesn't necessarily mean that mum

40
00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.749
and dad again take the kids there.

41
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.120
We find that by taking the services

42
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.189
to the schools and taking them to

43
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.807
the organisations with the people

44
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.681
in need, then we will uncover

45
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030
those people who ordinarily just

46
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.090
would not get tested.

47
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.037
For us in a kindergarten setting,

48
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.149
what we're looking at doing is

49
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.228
trying to identify any

50
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.049
visual needs that kids might have at

51
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.050
an early age.

52
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.050
So it's important that kids

53
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.580
get their eyes tested every 12

54
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.030
months, two years.

55
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.249
And we're here providing that

56
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.671
service for those parents who

57
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.487
wouldn't normally take their kids

58
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.760
and getting tested.

59
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.189
Usually during our screening

60
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.629
clinics, we cheque to see that they

61
00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.310
can see clearly in the distance.

62
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.989
We then cheque to make sure that

63
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.879
their eyes are working together and

64
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.689
independently.

65
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.889
We make sure that they can read up

66
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.389
close. And then we're also doing

67
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.128
some Stereopsis test.

68
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.574
That's just a fancy word that lets

69
00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:52.956
them know can they see in 3D.

70
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.500
And is there any colour deficiencies

71
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.699
in their vision before the

72
00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.989
optometrists are having a look at

73
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.659
the internals and making sure the

74
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.940
of the health of the eye.

75
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.640
There's a smile on the kid's faces

76
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.670
when you go in.

77
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.999
There is an absolutely incredible

78
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.769
experience to volunteer

79
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.930
and to try and help these kids see

80
00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.139
a little bit better.

81
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.690
It's important the work that we do,

82
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.729
because we know with kids, 80

83
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.749
per cent of their learning is

84
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.619
visual.

85
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.839
So if you can't see things

86
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.110
you can't learn.

87
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
If you can't learn.

88
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.390
You can't earn.

89
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.259
And it's very, very important that

90
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.979
the children have the best

91
00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.269
opportunity and the best start to

92
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.900
life in.
